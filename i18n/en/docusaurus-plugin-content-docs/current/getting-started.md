# Getting Started Guide

Tenengla desktop AI humanoid robots come in different versions including ESP32, Tuya Smart, and Digua versions. This documentation uses the ESP32 version as an example.

Before starting to build your ESP32+AI version Tenengla desktop AI humanoid robot, you need to understand some basic knowledge and prepare the necessary tools and materials. This page will help you get fully prepared.

## Basic Knowledge

Building an ESP32+AI version Tenengla robot requires some basic knowledge, but don't worry - these can be gradually mastered during the learning process:

### Basic Electronics Knowledge

- Understanding of simple circuit concepts (positive/negative poles, voltage, etc.)
- Recognition of basic electronic components (resistors, capacitors, sensors, etc.)
- Ability to use a multimeter for basic measurements (voltage, continuity)

### ESP32 Development Basics

- Understanding of ESP32 development board structure and pin definitions
- Familiarity with ESP-IDF development framework or Arduino ESP32 environment
- Ability to compile and upload programs to ESP32 development board

### Networking and API Knowledge (for learning source code)

- Basic Wi-Fi network configuration knowledge
- Understanding of API Keys and basic HTTP/WebSocket request concepts
- Knowledge of basic large language model API usage

### 3D Printing Basics (Optional)

- Understanding of basic 3D printing principles
- Ability to download and process STL files (if you plan to print the shell yourself)
- Recommended: JLCPCB 3D printing service
- Painting or coloring (customize with your favorite colors)

## Required Tools

The following are the basic tools needed to build an ESP32+AI version Tenengla robot:

- **Computer**: Windows/Mac/Linux system for programming and uploading programs
- **ESP-IDF Development Environment**: ESP32 official development environment (optional)
- **USB Type-C Data Cable**: For connecting ESP32 development board to computer
- **Screwdriver Set**: Small Phillips screwdriver
- **Wire Cutters and Strippers**: For processing wires and connections
- **Multimeter**: For testing circuits and troubleshooting
- **Soldering Iron Kit**: If soldering circuit boards yourself (requires hot air station or heating platform)

## Skill Requirements

Building an ESP32+AI version Tenengla robot requires the following skills:

- **Hands-on Ability**: Ability to assemble electronic components and mechanical parts following instructions
- **Basic Programming Knowledge**: Ability to understand and modify C/C++ code (optional)
- **Troubleshooting Ability**: Ability to identify and solve basic hardware and software problems
- **Patience and Attention to Detail**: Installation - firmware flashing - network configuration - Xiaozhi AI registration

## Time Schedule

Approximate time schedule to complete an ESP32+AI version Tenengla robot:

- **Material Preparation**: 1-5 days (online shopping for materials, PCB manufacturing, 3D printing)
- **Development Environment Setup**: 1-2 hours (optional)
- **Circuit Board Soldering**: 2-4 hours (optional)
- **Hardware Assembly**: 1-2 hours
- **Firmware Flashing and Configuration**: 0-1 hour
- **AI Function Setup and Testing**: 0-1 hour

## Suitable Audience

The ESP32+AI version Tenengla robot project is suitable for:

- **Intermediate Electronics Enthusiasts**: Those with basic Arduino or ESP32 experience
- **AI Learning Enthusiasts**: People interested in large language model API applications
- **Educators**: Teachers who want to teach AI and hardware integration
